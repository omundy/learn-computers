# Keyboard shortcuts & Workflows

Speed up your computing with keyboard shortcuts!

### Learning Objectives

Students who complete the following will be able to:

- Demonstrate basic computer keyboard commands like copy, paste, save  
- Perform more advanced commands like switching programs and finding text on a web page or text doc
- Explain how keyboard commands can increase computing efficiency
- Combine multiple keyboard commands to establish faster computing workflows  





## Part 1 – Introduction

In your group, discuss the following. `7 min`

- What tips do you know for making your computer use efficient?
- Do you currently use your non-mouse hand to enter commands on your computer keyboard?

Now, practice all the [commands](#commands) below, including the series of commands in the [workflows](#workflows) section.

- Which of the basic 🍏  or advanced 🔥 shortcuts are new to you?
- Did you find it awkward to use the shortcuts at first?



## Part 2 – Create an efficiency test `10 min`

In the 1910's, Frederick Taylor recorded the [workflows of laborers](https://www.shutterstock.com/video/clip-19628218-frederick-taylors-pig-iron-carrying-experiment-tests) and used the data to increase productivity. Through his [scientific management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management) analysis, he learned that efficiency actually *increased* if workers took more breaks and thus time to recover.

Similarly, we want to know how we might improve our computing efficiency using the keyboard. And perhaps more importantly, what could we do with the saved time?! Follow these instructions to create empirical tests that measure the efficiency of using (and not using) keyboard shortcuts over the equivalent actions, or series of actions.

1. Consider multiple commands and contexts (like the [text editing workflow](#workflows)).
1. More than one person in your group should take the test(s).
1. Perform each with and without keystrokes.
1. Move at the speed you would normally move.
1. For each action or series, record the number of clicks and the total time:
	- to move your mouse hand from the keyboard to type and back
	- to move your mouse on the screen. (e.g. from your file, ***aaaaaall*** the way up to the top left, to choose File > Save, then back down to the space where you were working on the screen)
	- to find the thing you need to click with the mouse

Here are some to get you started. Try to create 3 more, (use the web dev workflow if you are comfortable).

### Discussion

After you record your data and make it presentable, share it and your answers to the following with the class

1. Did you find it faster to use shortcuts? Which ones and how much?
1. Estimate the time difference between each in 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, or a whole semester of computer work.
1. Considering how often you perform these actions, what are some things you could do with that extra time?
1. Share your results with the class.

### Web development - Edit/Refresh Loop

Building web pages requires you to do a lot of repetitive tasks. It’s a good idea to learn proficiency and develop efficient workflows early on.
