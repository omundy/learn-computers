# Keyboard shortcuts

Speed up your workflow with keyboard shortcuts!

### Learning Objectives

Students who complete the following will be able to:

- Demonstrate basic computer keyboard commands like copy, paste, save  
- Perform more advanced commands like switching programs and finding text on a web page or text doc
- Explain how keyboard commands can increase computing efficiency
- Combine multiple keyboard commands to establish faster programming workflows  





## Part 1 – Introduction

In your group, discuss the following. `5 min`

- What tips do you know for making your computer use efficient?
- Do you currently use your non-mouse hand to enter commands on your computer keyboard?
- Which of the basic shortcuts (those with 🍏 [below](#commands)) are new to you?
- Why do you think some have this 🔥emoji?


## Part 2 – Practice commands

Practice all the [commands](#commands) below, including those in the [workflows](#workflows) section. `5 min`




## Part 3 – Measure efficiency

Have you ever wondered if you might improve your computing efficiency if you used keyboard commands? `10 min`

Create several tests to measure the efficiency of using keyboard shortcuts over the equivalent actions, or series of actions (workflows), using only a cursor. Consider multiple commands and contexts (like the web development workflow below). For each:

- Record the difference in time between using shortcuts for single as well as a series of actions.
- Record the number of clicks for each action or series
- Record the time it takes to move your hand from the keyboard to the mouse and back.
- Record the time it takes to move your mouse around the screen. – e.g. from your file, ***aaaaaall*** the way up to the top left to File > Save, back down to the space where you were working on the screen.
- Estimate the time you would save in 1 hour, 8 hours, 1 week, or 1 semester.


### Discussion

After you record your data and make it presentable, share it and your answers to the following with the class

- Did you find it faster to use shortcuts? Which ones and how much?
- Considering how often you perform these actions, what are some things you could do with that extra time?
- Share your results with the class.

## Workflows


### Web development - Edit/Refresh Loop

Building web pages requires you to do a lot of repetitive tasks. It’s a good idea to learn proficiency and develop efficient workflows early on.
