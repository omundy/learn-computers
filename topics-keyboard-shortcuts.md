## Introduction

Review the following sections and perform the activities on your own or with your group.

<details>
<summary>Learning Objectives</summary>

Students who complete the following will be able to:

- Demonstrate basic computer keyboard commands like copy, paste, save  
- Perform more advanced commands like switching programs and finding text on a web page or text doc
- Explain how keyboard commands can increase computing efficiency
- Combine multiple keyboard commands to establish faster computing workflows  

</details>

<details>
<summary>Preparation</summary>

Complete the following to prepare for this module

- [Command Line Crash Course](topics-command-line-crash-course.md)

</details>


In your group, discuss the following.

- What tips do you know for making your computer use efficient?
- Do you currently use your non-mouse hand to enter commands on your computer keyboard?

Now, practice all the [keyboard commands](#keyboard-commands) below, including the series of commands in the [text editing workflow](#workflows).

- Which of the basic 🍏  or advanced 🔥 shortcuts are new to you?
- Did you find it awkward to use the shortcuts at first?

## Create an efficiency test

In the 1910's, Frederick Taylor recorded the [workflows of laborers](https://www.shutterstock.com/video/clip-19628218-frederick-taylors-pig-iron-carrying-experiment-tests) and used the data to increase productivity. Through his [scientific management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management) analysis, he learned that efficiency actually *increased* if workers took more breaks because it gave them time to recover from the work.

Like Taylor, we want to know how we might improve our efficiency at the keyboard. And perhaps more importantly, what could we do with the saved time?! Follow these instructions to measure the efficiency of using (and not using) keyboard shortcuts over the equivalent actions, or series of actions.

1. Consider multiple commands and contexts (like the [text editing workflow](#workflows)).
1. More than one person in your group should take the test(s).
1. Perform each with and without keystrokes.
1. Move at the speed you would normally move.
1. For each action or series, record the number of clicks and the total time:
	1. to find the thing you need to click with the mouse
	1. to move your mouse hand from the keyboard to type and back
	1. to move your mouse on the screen. (e.g. from your file, ***aaaaaall*** the way up to the top left, to choose File > Save, then back down to the space where you were working on the screen)

Here are some to get you started. Try to create 3 more, (use the web dev workflow if you are comfortable).

## Discussion

After you record your data, prepare to share it and your answers to the following with the class

1. Did you find it faster to use shortcuts? Which shortcuts saved the most time?
1. Estimate the time difference between each in 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, or a whole semester of computer work.
1. Considering how often you perform these actions, what would you do with that extra time?
1. Share your results with the class.
