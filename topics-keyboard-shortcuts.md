# Keyboard shortcuts



## Class activity `10 min`

Do you use your non-mouse hand to enter commands on your computer keyboard? Have you ever wondered if you might improve your efficiency if you did? Perform the following with your group and share with the class.

1. Discussion:
	- Do you currently use keyboard shortcuts?
	- Which of the below shortcuts are new to you?
1. Measure efficiency:
	- Create 3-5 tests to measure the efficiency of using keyboard shortcuts over the equivalent actions—and series of actions—using only a cursor.
	- Measure and record:
		- The difference in time between using shortcuts for single as well as a series of actions.
		- The number of clicks for each action or series
		- Include the time it takes to move your hand from the keyboard to the mouse and back.
	 	- Include the time it takes to move your mouse on the screen for each. – e.g. from the file you are working on, ***aaaaaall*** the way up to the top left to File > Save, back down to the space where you were working on the screen.
 	- Consider multiple commands and contexts. – e.g. what if you create a new plain text `.txt` file on your computer, open the file in chrome. Then, edit, save, and reload the file in Chrome (see web development context below). Try it multiple times.
	- For each, estimate the time you would save in an 8 hour day.
1. Record the data and your answers to the following:
 	- Did you find it faster to use shortcuts? Which ones and how much?
 	- Considering how often you perform these actions, what could you do with the time saved per week, month, or year?
