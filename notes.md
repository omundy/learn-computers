### Data Issues

Margin of Error
- activity in data culture, hope can present



### APIs

Contact someone running that API and tell them your trouble. “You can’t make requests to it from a web frontend.” Send them your live project and see what they say. They might say you need to hit it from a server, which is fine, I can show you how.
In the meantime, so you can keep working, save a copy of the results (just go to the link you are providing fetch) as a .json file and call it locally. This will allow you to build the rest of your project while we figure out the API prob
