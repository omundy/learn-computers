### Data Issues

Margin of Error
- activity in data culture, hope can present



### APIs

Contact someone running that API and tell them your trouble. “You can’t make requests to it from a web frontend.” Send them your live project and see what they say. They might say you need to hit it from a server, which is fine, I can show you how.
In the meantime, so you can keep working, save a copy of the results (just go to the link you are providing fetch) as a .json file and call it locally. This will allow you to build the rest of your project while we figure out the API prob







## Github Markdown

GitHub doesn't permit you to adjust font sizes, styles, or colors when it renders Markdown. That's because the text needs to be legible on all sorts of systems with all sorts of font sizes and in both light and dark mode.
