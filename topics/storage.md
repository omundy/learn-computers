## About Storage


When speaking about USB drives, SD cards, or other computer storage:

- Storage **medium** (plural: **media**) is what actually holds the data (e.g. an SD card).
- Storage **device** is how you read or write data to the medium (e.g. an SD card reader writes data to the SD card).
- The storage media can be a fixed or permanent part of the storage device (e.g. a USB "flash" drive), or it can be removable, e.g. a CD-ROM can be taken out of a CD drive.
