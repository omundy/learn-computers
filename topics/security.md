## About security

- Web security (HTTPS, TLS, etc.)





---

## HTTPS

- [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) is the protocol used to access secure information over a computer network.
- HTTPS encypts communication ([HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)) using [transport layer security (TLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) to protect data in transit for authentication (e.g. login to a website) and privacy (eavesdropping, tampering)


- The authentication aspect of HTTPS requires a trusted third party to sign server-side digital [certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate) among other aspects of Public Key Infrastructure

## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

- PKI is a set of roles, policies, hardware, software and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption.


facilitate the secure electronic transfer of information


It is required for activities where simple passwords are an inadequate authentication method and more rigorous proof is required to confirm the identity of the parties involved in the communication and to validate the information being transferred.








Key/Config-authentication is used to solve the problem of authenticating the keys of the person (say "person B") to some other person ("person A") is talking to or trying to talk to. In other words, it is the process of assuring that the key of "person A" held by "person B" does in fact belong to "person A" and vice versa.



The simplest solution for this kind of problem is for the two concerned users to communicate and exchange keys.


There are various algorithms for both symmetric keys and asymmetric public key cryptography to solve this problem.


- A public key certificate is a document used to prove the validity of a public key.
- SSL certificates have a key pair: a public and a private key.






The certificate includes information about the key, information about the identity of its owner (called the subject), and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents (called the issuer).

If the signature is valid, and the software examining the certificate trusts the issuer, then it can use that key to communicate securely with the certificate's subject.
