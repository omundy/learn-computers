## Progressive vs Interlaced

1080p vs. 1080i

> Progressive scan is used for most cathode ray tube (CRT) computer monitors, all LCD computer monitors, and most HDTVs as the display resolutions are progressive by nature.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_scan

> Interlaced video (also known as interlaced scan) is a technique for doubling the perceived frame rate of a video display without consuming extra bandwidth.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlaced_video



1080i (1920Ã—1080) interlaced scan: 1,036,800 pixels (~1.04 MP).
1080p (1920Ã—1080) progressive scan: 2,073,600 pixels (~2.07 MP).
