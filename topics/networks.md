## IP Addresses

An [Internet Protocol (IP) address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) is a numerical label used to identify and connect devices to the Internet. Assigned by your wifi router or Internet Service Provider (ISP), it is required before your device can send data through the network.

ðŸ‘‰ On Google, ["what is my ip"](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+my+IP) will yield a number that looks like this:

```
24.224.66.226
```

---

IP Version 4 (IPv4) defines a dot-decimal number with four sections, each between 0-255.

```
1.1.1.1        => Cloudflare DNS server
8.8.8.8        => Google DNS server
192.168.1.1    => Default address to configure your home internet router
255.255.255.0  => Subnet mask used by TCP/IP to know if a host is local or remote.
```

Surprisingly, IPv4's 2<sup>32</sup> addresses were not enough for a constantly growing Internet and a new IPv6 standard was released in 1998 to increase the number to 2<sup>128</sup>!

```
IPv4 => 4,294,967,296
IPv6 => 340,282,366,920,938,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
```

## Domain Names

A domain name is a human-readable name for an IP address or web host.

For example, use `ping google.com` to find their IP address: <a href="http://64.233.177.104" target="_blank">64.233.177.104</a>

While easier to recall than the numbers in an IP address, domain names must be **resolved** via the [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) (DNS) to learn the IP address of the web host:

1. User types a domain name into a web browser
1. Browser performs a DNS query to find the IP address of the server
1. Browser then requests website files using the server's IP







---


## Basic Network Commands

The following network commands are essential for basic web development. Run them via the [Command Line Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) (CLI) on any Linux, Mac, or Windows (ðŸ¤ž) command line.

1. whois
1. ping
1. traceroute
1. curl
1. ssh


---


## whois

> Who owns this domain?

The whois system contains records about domain ownership. The [Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers](https://www.icann.org/) (ICANN) regulates domain name registration, but the records are held by many companies, known as registries.




---


Anyone can query the whois list receive details like:

- **registrant** - the legal domain owner and their contact information
- **registrar** - the company the registrant used to create the registration
- **dates** of the registration, including the first, most recent, and expiration date
- **nameservers** of the host to which the domain name points

ðŸ‘‰ Try a whois search with the following names, and at least one additional domain. What do you notice?

```bash
whois davidson.edu
whois cnn.com
whois owenmundy.com
```







---


## ping

> How fast is my connection to this domain?

`ping` (Packet INternet Groper) checks network connectivity and latency (the time it takes data to move across a network in milliseconds (ms)) between two nodes.

It is a simple way to check your device's connection to the outside world. You can use ping with a domain name or IP address.


---

ðŸ‘‰ **Try it out**

Ping Google's domain name. By default, ping will continue executing until you use `Ctrl+C` to interrupt the execution.

```bash
ping google.com
```

Ping Google's DNS server 5 times and then stop

```bash
ping -c 5 8.8.8.8
```

Run `ping` with different domains to compare speeds. Why might there be differences?






---


## traceroute

> What is the path to a domain?

The `traceroute` command is useful for network troubleshooting. It provides latency information and identifies each node along the path to the target destination.


---


ðŸ‘‰ **Try it out**

Trace the path your packets take to a destination:

```bash
traceroute google.com
```

By default, traceroute uses [UDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol) ports which are blocked by some firewalls. If your traceroute "hangs", try it with the [ICMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Control_Message_Protocol) port

```bash
traceroute -I google.com
```





---


## curl

> Request data from the network

[curl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) (Client URL) offers a variety of functions for requesting resources on a network.


ðŸ‘‰ **Try it out**

```bash
# fetch a resource and display it in the shell
curl https://davidson.edu

# fetch a resource and *save it on your computer*
curl -o index.html https://davidson.edu

# fetch a resource and display only the response headers
curl --head https://google.com

# fetch a resource and display *all* headers
curl -v https://google.com
```

---

## More curl examples

```bash
# view request and response headers returned from a resource
curl -v https://davidson.edu

# view only response header
curl --head https://davidson.edu
```

## Conclusion

This concludes the introduction to network CLI tools. 

I'll show SSH from the advanced section before we continue to the next item in the schedule




---

## Advanced Network Tools






---


## SSH

Secure SHell is a popular tool for connecting to other computers on the network. With "SSH" you log in to a remote computer and can execute commands just as if you were in the same room. SSH uses [public-key cryptography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) to secure data.

Common scenarios where you would use SSH:

- To edit files on a web server
- To edit contents of a database on a server
- To pull changes to a Git repository on your web server



---

ðŸ‘‰ **Try it out**

If you know your username and password, and are permitted to connect via SSH to your host, then try it out. The first time you connect you will be prompted to trust the secure key on the remote host and enter your password*.

```bash
ssh  <username>@<servername>
```

<div class="slides-small caption">*Command lines typically do not display password input. If you make a mistake just press <kbd>delete</kbd> a few times and start over.</div>

If successful you'll see a welcome message. You could then edit a file using the Nano text editor. This command will open a file to edit (creating the file if it doesn't currently exist):

```bash
nano hello.html
```

Use <kbd>Ctl</kbd> + <kbd>o</kbd> to save and <kbd>Ctl</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd> to exit nano.











---

## SFTP

SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) allows you to send files across a network with the command line. It is usually more convenient to use a GUI like Cyberduck.

ðŸ‘‰ To create an SFTP connection type the following.

```bash
sftp <username>@<servername>
```

To "put" a file simple type: `put <local_filename>` at the `sftp>` prompt like so:

```bash
sftp> put hello.jpg
```





---


## dig

> Just give me the nameservers

`dig` (Domain Information Groper) is used in DNS lookup to query the nameservers, or troubleshoot related DNS issues. It returns info on the A record by default.

```bash
dig davidson.edu
```

If you want all records including MX (email) and NS (nameservers):

```bash
dig google.com ANY
```








---


## ifconfig

The InterFace CONFIGurator is used to inspect, configure, and/or enable/disable network interfaces.

ðŸ‘‰ Print your [MAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address) (Media Access Control) address. This is a unique identifier assigned to each network interface controller on your system (e.g. ethernet, WiFi, and bluetooth).

```bash
ifconfig | grep ether
```

ðŸ‘‰ Print your IP address

```bash
ipconfig getifaddr en0
```

`ifconfig` reports your device address ***on your subnet*** (something like `192.168.*.*`). Use an site on the internet to see the IP address that you connect from.

```bash
ifconfig en0
```







---


## Netstat

[netstat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netstat) (NETwork STATistics) displays information about TCP, routing tables, and all virtual connections to/from your computer. [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) is the set of communications protocols used to transfer data over the Internet and similar computer networks. The current protocols are [Transmission Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) (TCP) and [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol) (IP).

ðŸ‘‰ To view a list of all the network interfaces (a.k.a. "[sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket)") on your machine:

```bash
netstat -at
```
View statistics for network interfaces
```bash
netstat -i
```





---


## Tcpdump

[tcpdump](https://www.tcpdump.org/) is a network package analyzer. It can be used to monitor network activity or even capture data packets.

To prevent others from viewing your network activity without permission (a.k.a. a [Man in the Middle attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)) this command must be run with `sudo` (Super User DO) permission [using your password](#about-passwords).

ðŸ‘‰ To view all your network activity in real time, run the following. Use <kbd>Ctl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> to exit:

```bash
sudo tcpdump -nS
```



---

## Port Scanning with NMap

This will perform a port scan to list open ports / identify running services on a remote host.


```bash
# install
brew install nmap
# test
nmap scanme.nmap.org
```

> Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-09-22 10:59 EDT
> Nmap scan report for scanme.nmap.org (45.33.32.156)
> Host is up (0.078s latency).
> Not shown: 996 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
> PORT      STATE SERVICE
> 22/tcp    open  ssh
> 80/tcp    open  http
> 9929/tcp  open  nping-echo
> 31337/tcp open  Elite


http://scanme.nmap.org/




---


## Wireshark

Wireshark can inspect network packets with a GUI.

ðŸ‘‰ Mac users can install it using this script (via [homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/wireshark))

```bash
brew install --cask wireshark
```
Windows users should install from the [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) website.
