## Image formats

Humans are intensely visual, and it follows that our most important tool is more than capable at representing the world through pictures.

## Raster vs. Vector

All images you see on a computer are both the data that makes up the file, as well as the rendered data rendered using a pixel display. So by the time you see the image it has been translated to pixel space.

Still, these images are stored and handled very differently.

---


Type | Description | File size | Example formats
--- | --- |--- |---
Raster | Also called "bitmap" - image data stored as pixels | Large | JPG, PNG, GIF
Hybrid | A binary file that contains both raster and vector data | Medium | EPS, PDF
Vector | Image rendered from list of points describing polygons | Relatively small | SVG
Character sets | 16 bit characters reference fonts or emoji stored on device  | Tiny | üëçü¶Ñüç§

### Common Image Formats

Extension | Name | Release | Compression | Description
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
[JPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG) | Joint Photographic Experts Group | 1992 | lossy | Good for photography and images with lots of colors or gradients
[PNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG) | Portable Network Graphics | 1996 | lossless | High-quality (24-bit RGB or 32-bit RGBA colors) with a true alpha channel
[GIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF) | Graphic Image Format | 1987 | lossy | (8 bits per pixel) up to 256 different colors
[SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG) | Scalable Vector Graphics | 2001 | lossless | A vector graphics format stored in XML text files. Small file sizes so great for the web.
[EPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulated_PostScript) | Encapsulated PostScript | 1987 | lossless | Text and bitmaps in a single file. 
[PDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) | Portable Document Format | 1993 | lossless* | Text and bitmaps in a single file. Based originally on PostScript, but now a widely used standard. 
[PSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop#File_format) | Photoshop Document | 1990 | lossless | Photoshop's default format. Very large, so images must be exported at lower resolutions for the web.

*Can save as lossy or lossless depending on settings
