## Pseudocode

Writing out simplified instructions for a program (a.k.a. "[pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode)") you intend to build can help plan your approach.

Much like you would make a sketch for a painting, or a wireframe for a design, pseudocode can assist in thinking about your structure, where to put logic, or how your code will respond to events beforehand, while you still have flexibility to make changes.


---


Even more, writing pseudocode as comments gives you a structure within which you can add actual code, and placeholders for instructions you will eventually add.

While written in English, this example maintains a computational approach, borrowing the phrases, [keywords], and even tabbed structure of a programming language:

```
[Function] getResults
    Make a [request] to the server
    [Fetch] the latest 20 results in chronological order
    [For] each result, [append]
        the image or media
        number of likes
        the first 25 characters of the caption
        Assign [click listeners] to the like button and image to call specific [functions]
        [If] the user has clicked the like button
            show that it has been clicked
    If the user scrolls to a point where there are no more results, start over [getResults()]
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Try it out**

Reverse engineer an existing work to practice writing pseudocode.

1. Examine this [Random Article Generator](https://codepen.io/owenmundy/full/PomvjqW) and discuss with your partner
    1. What was needed to build this project?
    1. How do you think it works?
2. List the instructions using your preferred human language (English, German, etc.)
    1. Start from the beginning, with the data sources and variables.
    1. Describe logic, functions, and control structures that make it work.
    1. List the event listeners that connect the UI to the code in the background.
3. Look at the code for the [Random Article Generator](https://codepen.io/owenmundy/pen/PomvjqW?editors=1010)
    1. What did you get right and what
    1. What questions do you have?
4. Select [another work that uses randomness](https://github.com/omundy/dig245-regenerative#example-works) and try it again.

### Notes

- State, state control, build state machine
- Iteration, structure, flow chart to describe
- logic / flow structure, flow chart to describe
- algorithms - create your own to represent some thing that exists in the world.


## Discussion

In your group, discuss the following.


## Keep practicing
