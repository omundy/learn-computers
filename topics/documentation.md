## About

<div class="twocolumn">

<div class="col">

You completed your final project and turned it in. The last thing you want to do right now is think about it.

Six months later, you are in a job interview and they ask to see your work.

The problem is, you've slept since then, nothing is live anymore, and you didn't document it.

## Capture everything

ðŸš« "I'll just record a quick screen capture ..."

Documentation should be an ongoing process, from start to finish, for many reasons:

- To help you finish the work, tracking progress from conception to completion.
- To archive iterations, things learned, and successes and failures, to reference later.
- To tell the story of your project for all potential audiences: Professors, peers, potential employers, grad school admissions, award selection committees, academics who may write about your work, and of course, the public.

## Iterate, iterate, iterate.

Iteration is a powerful method for improving practically anything. Collect documentation in a Google Doc and paste links, images, notes, etc. as you progress.

- **Research** (articles, artworks, concepts) while developing the concept.
- **Methods** (different mediums, practices, tools, etc.) you considered and tested.
- **Progress** (insights, discoveries, interesting knowledge gained) towards your goal(s).
- **Versions** distinct working examples of successive phases of your project?

## Screenshots and videos

- Add a folder to your project folder and add screenshots as you make progress. The filenames will be ordered by data automatically.
- Capture the entire screen on a Mac: <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd> - [See more Mac and Windows screenshot shortcuts](..html/keyboard-shortcuts.html#screenshots).
- Capture video on a Mac: [Quicktime](https://support.apple.com/guide/quicktime-player/record-your-screen-qtp97b08e666/mac) (free) or [Giphy Capture](https://giphy.com/apps/giphycapture) (free), [Screenflow](http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm) ($).

## Source code

Your source code is part of the work and you should share it in your documentation:

- Make it live on Github or at least create a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) so that others can see and use it.
- [Share and share alike](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/) attribute others' source code (their name and URL) in a comment preceding the borrowed code.




---

## Collect it all

Combine all of the above (the code, statements, screenshots/videos, images, flowcharts) into a single document, preferably that is online and you can share with others:

- Edit multiple segments, text, and other documentation into a video
- A Google Presentation or slide deck
- A white paper (see next slide) published online as a PDF or web page




---

## Edit a video

Sometimes a video is needed to tell the whole story. For example, in both [Immaterials: light painting WiFi](http://www.nearfield.org/2011/02/wifi-light-painting/) and [My little piece of Privacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKhbUjVyKIc&ab_channel=NiklasRoy), the videos:

- Are published online for the world to see, share, or embed.
- Combine text, footage of the object, game, or interface working, screencasts of the command line.
- Tell the story dramatically, with music, a story, and/or a narrator or text subtitles.

## White paper

White papers offer a common format to document, discuss, and share research-based projects. In your document should:

- Include a statement (800â€“1200 words) explaining the ideas behind your project.
- Document your process with images, sketches, flowcharts, links to videos.

Suggestions for preparing such reports:
