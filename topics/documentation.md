## About

<div class="twocolumn">

<div class="col">

You completed your final project and turned it in. The last thing you want to do right now is think about it.

Six months later, you are in a job interview and they ask to see your work.

The problem is, you've slept since then, nothing is live anymore, and you didn't document it.

## Capture everything

ðŸš« "I'll just record a quick screen capture ..."

Documentation should be an ongoing process, from start to finish, for many reasons:

- To help you finish the work, tracking progress from conception to completion.
- An archive of your creative energy, the things learned, and successes and failures, that you can tap into and reference later.
- To tell the story of your project for all potential audiences: Professors, peers, potential employers, grad school admissions, award selection committees, academics who may write about your work, and of course, the public.

## Iterate, iterate, iterate.

Iteration is a powerful method for improving practically anything. Collect documentation that can show your process.

- **Research** (articles, artworks, concepts) while developing the concept.
- **Methods** (different mediums, practices, tools, etc.) you considered and tested.
- **Progress** (insights, discoveries, interesting knowledge gained) towards your goal(s).
- **Versions** distinct working examples of successive phases of your project?

## Screenshots and links

- Add a folder on your desktop and add screenshots as you make progress. The filenames will be ordered by data automatically.
- Make a Google Doc and paste links in there as you learn from them. Put notes under each and keep adding to it.



---

## Source code

Your source code is part of the work and you should share it in your documentation:

- Make it live on Github or at least create a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) so that others can see and use it.
- [Share and share alike](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/) attribute others' source code (their name and URL) in a comment preceding the borrowed code.

## Video

Sometimes a video is needed to tell the whole story. For example, in both [Immaterials: light painting WiFi](http://www.nearfield.org/2011/02/wifi-light-painting/) and [My little piece of Privacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKhbUjVyKIc&ab_channel=NiklasRoy), they:

- Are published online for the world to see (freely)
- Can be shared, embedded to spread the word.
- Combine text, footage of the object working, screencasts of the command line, and tell the story dramatically.

## Presentation, PDF or web page

Combine all of the above (the code, statements, video, images) into a single document or white paper.
