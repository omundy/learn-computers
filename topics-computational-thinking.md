## Pseudocode

Writing out simple instructions for a program you intend to build (a.k.a. "[pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode)") can help plan your approach. Much like you would make a sketch for a painting, or a wireframe for a design, pseudocode can assist in thinking about your structure, where to put logic, or how your code will respond to events beforehand, while you still have flexibility to make changes.

While written in English, this example maintains a computational approach, borrowing the phrases, [keywords], and even tabbed structure of a programming language:

```
[Function] getResults
    Make a [request] to the server
    [Fetch] the latest 20 results in chronological order
    [For] each result, [append]
        the image or media
        number of likes
        the first 25 characters of the caption
        Assign [click listeners] to the like button and image to call specific [functions]
        [If] the user has clicked the like button
            show that it has been clicked
    If the user scrolls to a point where there are no more results, start over [getResults()]
```


ðŸ‘‰ **Try it out**

This prompt to reverse engineer an existing work will give you practice writing pseudocode.

1. Select one of the following works:
    - [eBay Feedback Generator](https://thesurrealist.co.uk/feedback) (2005)
    - [Hacker Simulator](https://hacker-simulator.com/)
    - [itadakimasu.app/](https://itadakimasu.app/)
    - [Tarot-o-bot](https://tarotobot-reboot.illo.tv/) (2019)
    - [Site Shaker](https://hartmut-bohnacker.de/projects/site-shaker) (2018)
    - [University Title Generator](https://universitytitlegenerator.com/)
1. Discuss with your partner
    1. What was needed to build this project?
    1. How do you think it works?
1. In your preferred human language (English, German, etc.) list the instructions in this program:
    1. Start from the beginning, with the data sources and variables.
    1. Describe the logic, functions, and control structures that make up the main functionality.
    1. List the event listeners that connect the UI to the code in the background.
1. Take a [look at the code](https://github.com/fiatflux/uni-title-gen/blob/master/titlegen.py)
    1. What did you get right?





## Paper prototype  

Make a simple version on paper or whiteboard. Use a coin for random variables.

### Notes

- State, state control, build state machine
- Iteration, structure, flow chart to describe
- logic / flow structure, flow chart to describe
- algorithms - create your own to represent some thing that exists in the world.
