## How do computers store data?

Computers don't actually *store data* (text, photos, video, etc.). Rather, computer storage has millions of tiny switches that can each be either `on` or `off`.

<a href="assets/img/data-basics/data-switch-wall.png"><img src="assets/img/data-basics/data-switch-wall.png" height="310"></a> <a href="assets/img/data-basics/microchip.jpg"><img src="assets/img/data-basics/microchip-cropped.png" height="310"></a>

A switch can be in only one of two states, `on` or `off`. Thus, this single binary value, the smallest unit of data a computer can store, is aptly named a **bit**.


<a href="assets/img/data-basics/data-switch-symbols.png"><img align="left" src="assets/img/data-basics/data-switch-symbols.png" height="150"></a>

Power | ON | OFF
:--- | :---: | :----:
Boolean | true | false
Binary | 1 | 0
Symbol | ‚èΩ | ‚≠ò

<sup>(1) The on/off binary symbols are ubiquitous on mechanical interfaces (2) The ‚èª "power on" symbol on computers (3) This table aligns values of a switch with their binary, boolean, and symbolic equivalent.</sup>







## Bits and Bytes

The switches that store binary data are grouped in bundles of **8 bits**, or **1 byte**. While a switch can be in only one of 2 states, a row of n switches can be in one of 2<sup>n</sup> states! This table describes common file size units and corresponding examples.


Unit | Symbol | Value | Example size
:--- | :---: | :---- | :----
1 bit | bit | `0` or `1` | a boolean value (e.g. `true`)
1 byte | byte | 8 bits | a single text character
1 kilobyte | KB | 1024 bytes | a multipage text document
1 megabyte | MB | 1024 kilobytes | a medium-resolution photo file
1 gigabyte | GB | 1024 megabytes | a feature length movie
1 terabyte | TB | 1024 gigabytes | a hard drive
1 petabyte | PB | 1024 terabytes |


üëâ **Try it out**

Let's confirm the above information about a byte. Enter a single character `a` into this [BitCounter](https://lingojam.com/BitCounter) and [ByteCounter](https://lingojam.com/ByteCounter). You should see it is equal to 8 bits and 1 byte, respectively.

The binary representation of the Latin character `a` is `01000001`. But if you plug that sequence into a [Binary to Decimal Converter](https://www.binaryhexconverter.com/binary-to-decimal-converter) it will output not a letter, but the number `65`. Why?










## Character Encoding

Character encoding is the process by which computers store and represent text by assigning numbers (and their binary equivalents) to alphanumeric characters. The ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) (~1963) is based on the English alphabet and encodes 128 characters which each use 7-bits.

<a href="assets/img/data-basics/ascii.png"><img src="assets/img/data-basics/ascii.png" height="350"></a>

As computing expanded, more character sets were added to accommodate other languages, characters, and symbols.
The Unicode (1988) standard(s) now define 143,859 characters. Specifically, UTF-8 (capable of 1,112,064 chars), which uses one to four 8-bit bytes, is the most popular, and ensures everyone sees the same character.

üëâ **Try it out**

1. [Count](https://lingojam.com/BitCounter) the bits for each of the following text examples. **Try to guess the outcomes first!** Some of these will not produce what you may think. Do you know why?

```
a
abc
0123456789
01234 56789
√º
√±
üòÇ
```

2. Below you can see the binary representations for the above. Use the [Binary to ASCII](https://www.convertbinary.com/to-text/) and [Binary <> UTF-8](http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/convert-text-to-binary/) converters to confirm this. One of these tools will only be able to convert some sequences, do you know why?

```
01100001
01100001 01100010 01100011
00110000 00110001 00110010 00110011 00110100 00110101 00110110 00110111 00111000 00111001
00110000 00110001 00110010 00110011 00110100 00100000 00110101 00110110 00110111 00111000 00111001
11000011 10111100
11000011 10110001
11110000 10011111 10011000 10000010
```



3. The first 128 characters of UTF8 are based on the ASCII standard. If you compare this table to the above ASCII chart you will find a slight discrepancy. Yet you can still [convert](http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/convert-text-to-binary/) each to the appropriate text character. Do you know what the discrepancy is?

ASCII | b | i | t | s
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Binary | `01100010` | `01101001` | `01110100` | `01110011`
Decimal | `98` | `105` | `116` | `115`


<details>
<summary>Answers</summary>

1. These numbers `01234 56789` are each 8 bits, but so is the space character between them since whitespace (spaces, tabs, returns) also require storage. So the total is `88`; Foreign characters like `√º` and `√±` were not included in the ASCII standard. They are covered by Unicode, and each require `16` bits; Most emoji require `32` bits or `4` bytes `üòÇ`
2. Since ASCII can only represent 7 bits, anything over 1 byte will fail if converted to ASCII. Instead you have to convert to UTF-8 text.
3. ASCII only required 7 bits for each character `2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2`, but Unicode just adds a zero at the beginning of the binary sequence since it is 1-4 bytes.

## File encoding


While all data on computers is stored on the disk as binary data, some file types use binary file encoding, and others use text file encoding. A typical example is a `.txt` file. If you open it in a plain text editor like TextEdit on Mac you will see the text contents. However, most image files cannot be opened in a text editor.

<img src="assets/img/data-basics/cat-binary.png">

The above shows a photo of a [cat](assets/img/data-basics/cat.png) (on the left) displayed by an application that can read and render the image data as pixels on a screen, and (right) the binary representation of the file's data.

üëâ **Try it out** on the command line with [hexdump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_dump). Save the cat image to your computer and run this command:

```bash
hexdump -C /path/to/your/cat.png
```


### Binary-encoded files

- Stored as bits (binary 1s and 0s) and may include multiple types of data in the same file (e.g video and audio).
- More efficient to store and access but can easily become corrupted.
- Examples `.jpg`, `.pdf`, and `.mp4`.


### Text-encoded files

- Also stored as bits, but represented by actual text characters.
- You can open text files in many types of editors.
- Examples `.txt`, `.html`, and `.cs`.

File encoding [is not the same as](https://kunststube.net/encoding/) character encoding.

If you can open ***and read*** a file in a plain text editor (e.g. [Notepad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Notepad) on Windows, or [TextEdit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextEdit) on Mac) it is a text file. However, if the content of the file appears as mostly garbled text, it is a binary file.

<sub>A `.png` file opened in TextEdit</sub>


### Examine filetypes in plain text

1. Find examples of each on your own computers  
1. Open them in a plain text editor to verify
1. What clues can you see in the binary formats to tell you about the filetype?
