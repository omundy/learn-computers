## Learning Objectives

Students who complete this lesson will be able to:

- Recall how computers store and use binary data
- Organize data storage amounts by their respective sizes
- List common data types and recall examples of each
- Explain what a collection is and provide examples
- Compare text vs. binary-encoded files
- Use appropriate formats to create data representations of real world examples


## Introduction

Before continuing, complete the [command line crash course](topics-command-line-crash-course.md)





### notes



- Use appropriate data formats to create representations of objects, things, in the world
	- CSV, JSON, etc.


- Next steps
	- data cleaning








### Bits and Bytes

Computers don't actually store text (letters and numbers) or pictures. The only thing a computer can store are bits.

A bit is considered to be the smallest unit of data and can have only two different values: `1` or `0`. You could also think of this **binary** relationship as `true` | `false` or `yes` | `no`. Since computers use electricity to store data, a bit is actually a blip of electricity that is either **on** `1` or **off** `0`.

Since computers are storing only 1s and 0s, the binary sequences must be converted to text using an encoding scheme.



01100010 01101001 01110100 01110011
b        i        t        s



n this encoding, 01100010 stands for the letter "b", 01101001 for the letter "i", 01110100 stands for "t" and 01110011 for "s". A certain sequence of bits stands for a letter and a letter stands for a certain sequence of bits. If you can keep this in your head for 26 letters or are really fast with looking stuff up in a table, you could read bits like a book.

The above encoding scheme happens to be ASCII. A string of 1s and 0s is broken down into parts of eight bit each (a byte for short). The ASCII encoding specifies a table translating bytes into human readable letters. Here's a short excerpt of that table:




ðŸ‘‰ **Try it out**

Enter the following text examples into this [BitCounter](https://lingojam.com/BitCounter) and [ByteCounter](https://lingojam.com/ByteCounter). *Try to guess the outcomes first!*

1. How many bits? How many bytes? `a`
1. How many bits? How many bytes? `abc`
1. How many bits? How many bytes? `hello world!`
1. How many bits? How many bytes? `ðŸ˜‚`

### Computers are binary machines

All files on computers are stored as 1's and 0's. Images, text files, music, software, everythingâ€”They are all 0's and 1's. The only difference is that they are interpreted differently depending upon what program can open them.

<img src="assets/img/cat-binary.png">

The above shows a photo of a [cat](assets/img/cat.png) (on the left) displayed by an application that can read and render the image data as pixels on a screen, and (right) the binary representation of the file's data.

ðŸ‘‰ **Try it out** on the command line with [hexdump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_dump). Save the cat image to your computer and run this command:

```bash
hexdump -C /path/to/your/cat.png
```








## File encoding

All computer files encode data in one of two different formatsâ€”binary or text.

### Binary-encoded files

- Stored as bits (binary 1s and 0s) and may include multiple types of data in the same file (e.g video and audio).
- More efficient to store and access but can easily become corrupted.
- Examples `.jpg`, `.pdf`, and `.mp4`.


### Text-encoded files

- Also stored as bits, but represented by actual text characters.
- You can open text files in many types of editors.
- Examples `.txt`, `.html`, and `.cs`.

File encoding [is not the same as](https://kunststube.net/encoding/) character encoding.

If you can open ***and read*** a file in a plain text editor (e.g. [Notepad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Notepad) on Windows, or [TextEdit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextEdit) on Mac) it is a text file. However, if the content of the file appears as mostly garbled text, it is a binary file.

### Examine filetypes in plain text

1. Find examples of each on your own computers  
1. Open them in a plain text editor to verify
1. What clues can you see in the binary formats to tell you about the filetype?









## Common Data Types

Thus, a boolean type requires less memory to store than a string type. The string `"false"` contains 5 characters and thus requires 5 bytes. Zero


A data type defines the kind of data that is stored. This is important for many reasons:






Here are some common types and examples of each:

- Booleans (`true` and `false`)
- Numbers (integers and floats)
- Strings
- Collections

Note: A type is different than it's value. `true` is the value of the type `Boolean`.



## Discussion

Discuss the following:

1. Give an example of each of the types above
2. What type is this? `"3.14"`





## Data Collections

- Explain what a collection (data points, arrays, objects) is and give examples

- Arrays
- Objects
- Serialized vs. Unserialized data



e.g. A time series is a collection of observations made sequentially in time.






## Hierarchical Types

- json, xml, etc.
